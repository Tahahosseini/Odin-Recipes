          When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more
          than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One
          of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks
          up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most
          popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades.
          Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read
          all about his life and legacy here.

            ground beef.
          </li>
          <li>
            Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with
            the meat to add tons of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
            tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and
            enhance the flavor of the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
            parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds,
            and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
            extra decadent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
            lasagna when you cut into it.
          </li>
